This repo aims to create a distributed client-server application.

For test purposes Docker can be used. To install docker follow this link:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

You can find Docker files for creating the Docker Images under /docker/<server | client>/.

Execute them by using to the command in CLI:
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t server-application
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t client-application

After building the images server contaiers can be started using the docker compose files in /docker/server 
by using the command:
docker compose -f scaling-server_compose.yml up
docker compose up

To start the Clients in an interactive mode, execute the following command:
docker run -it --name <container_name> \                   
  --network server_application_distributed_systems_test_network \
  -p <PORT>:50550/udp \
  -p <PORT>:65431/udp \
  -p <PORT>:50510 \
  client-application \
  python3 _client_main.py

e.g.
docker run -it --name client1 \                   
  --network server_application_distributed_systems_test_network \
  -p 50420:50550/udp \
  -p 65435:65431/udp \
  -p 50519:50510 \
  client-application \
  python3 _client_main.py

Define the port mappings as you prefer them to be.
